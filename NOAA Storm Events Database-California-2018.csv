The high broke down by the 4th as a low pressure system pushed through Northern California bringing generally light precipitation to the area although a few locations picked up between a quarter and half an inch of rainfall. A few inches of snow fell above 8000 feet. Another low pressure pushed through Northern California on the morning of January 6 which brought half an inch to an inch of rain to much of Yosemite Park and Mariposa Counties with lesser amounts further south. Snow was mainly confined to elevations above 8000 feet with this system. A strong low pressure system moved southward off the Central California coast then pushed inland across Southern California between the morning of the 8th and the evening of the 9th. This system produced more substantial rainfall across the area with many locations in the Southern Sierra Nevada picking up between an inch and 2 inches of liquid precipitation. Strong southerly flow ahead of the system resulted in warming across the area ahead of the low and snow levels were above 10000 feet on the 8th when most of the precipitation fell. As the low moved closer to the area on the morning of the 9th, strong downslope winds developed in the south end of the San Joaquin Valley and the valley facing slopes of the Kern County Mountains. Winds along interstate 5 frequently gusted above 50 mph and the Grapevine Peak RAWS (which is on an exposed ridge top) gusted up to 94 mph. Areas of street flooding were reported in the Bakersfield area on the morning of the 9th, and some mudslides were produced by heavy rainfall closing roads at the intersection of Cuddy Valley Road and Mil Portero Highway west of Frazier Park and on Redrock Randsburg Road in the Kern County Desert. Colder air pushed into the area on the back side of the low lowering the snow levels to 5000 to 5500 feet where a few inches of snow fell in post-frontal showery precipitation. A few thunderstorms were observed in the south end of the San Joaquin Valley in the unstable airmass. The precipitation had ended by the morning of the 10th as the low moved out of the area. However, upslope low clouds lingered in much of the San Joaquin Valley and the lower foothills of the Southern Sierra Nevada and Kern County Mountains while dense fog slowed down traffic along Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area and along Highway 58 near Tehachapi. Most of the low cloud deck cleared out by the evening of the 10th.",Pictures indicating roadway flooding in downtown Bakersfield near the intersection on Union Ave. and Truxton Ave. were received on Facebook and Twitter.,CSV

The high broke down by the 4th as a low pressure system pushed through Northern California bringing generally light precipitation to the area although a few locations picked up between a quarter and half an inch of rainfall. A few inches of snow fell above 8000 feet. Another low pressure pushed through Northern California on the morning of January 6 which brought half an inch to an inch of rain to much of Yosemite Park and Mariposa Counties with lesser amounts further south. Snow was mainly confined to elevations above 8000 feet with this system. A strong low pressure system moved southward off the Central California coast then pushed inland across Southern California between the morning of the 8th and the evening of the 9th. This system produced more substantial rainfall across the area with many locations in the Southern Sierra Nevada picking up between an inch and 2 inches of liquid precipitation. Strong southerly flow ahead of the system resulted in warming across the area ahead of the low and snow levels were above 10000 feet on the 8th when most of the precipitation fell. As the low moved closer to the area on the morning of the 9th, strong downslope winds developed in the south end of the San Joaquin Valley and the valley facing slopes of the Kern County Mountains.

Areas of street flooding were reported in the Bakersfield area on the morning of the 9th, and some mudslides were produced by heavy rainfall closing roads at the intersection of Cuddy Valley Road and Mil Portero Highway west of Frazier Park and on Redrock Randsburg Road in the Kern County Desert.

The heaviest flooding was in Groveland, where 4-5 of rain fell, combining with 8-9 of rain in higher elevations upstream. There was also widespread damage in Tuolumne County to roads from debris flows, soil erosion, erosion of water conveyance systems, sewer systems that were inundated with excess water and debris. Roads damaged inluded state Highways 49 and 132. Moccasin Dam was damaged and came close to failure, with  road closures. A tornado struck an amphitheater in Wheatland and caused minor damage. Heavy snow caused travel problems over Sierra highways.","A period of heavy rain upstream from Moccasin Dam, in which about three inches fell during four hours led to significant erosion and at least one landslide. It caused a massive amount of water and debris to run downhill into the Moccasin Reservoir. The water level rose to 3 times the normal reservoir capacity and the emergency spillway was utilized. There was severe erosion of the emergency spillway and potential for the dam to fail.  The Power house and staff at the Moccasin Fish Hatchery were evacuated due to potential failure. All the fish in the Moccasin Creek Hatchery were killed when it flooded from the water coming over the emergency spillway.  The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning associated with the probable dam failure, and the sheriff advised residents to avoid the area as a matter of public safety. The warning was reduced to a watch until the reservoir was drained and then the watch was canceled once the reservoir was drained.||Cleanup and repair efforts associated with a major storm that damaged Tuolumne County's Moccasin Creek Dam in March is expected to cost roughly $43 million, according to an estimate by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, which owns and operates the dam.

The fire was not fully contained until November 25. This fire was the most destructive wildfire in California history, destroying much of the city of Paradise, the community of Concow, and damaging the towns of Pulga and Magalia. There were 18,804 structures destroyed, 13,696 of them single homes, along with 514 commercial structures and 3,718 outbuildings and 153,336 acres burned. There were a total of 86 deaths from the fire, with 12 civilians and 5 firefighters injured. There were 3 people missing as of 1/24/2019, when Butte County Sheriff closed their missing persons call center for the Camp Fire. Damage costs to insured buildings has been estimated to be at least $10 billion. |Conditions which lead to this fire included several recent years with drought conditions, late spring rainfall bringing additional growth of grass for fuel, dry weather for seven months prior to the fire, very low humidity due to several north wind events, record dry fuel and gusty northeast winds the day of the fire. Local wind gusts to 40 to 50 mph were measured nearby at Jarbo Gap, with a peak gust in the early morning of 52 mph. These winds caused the fire to spread very quickly. The fire forced the rapid evacuation of over 27,000 people from Paradise, Magalia, Centerville, Concow, Pulga, Butte Creek Canyon, Berry Creek and Yankee Hill. The fire also threatened the communities of Butte Valley, Chico, Forest Ranch, Helltown, Inskip, Oroville, and Stirling City. All residents were not allowed to return home until December 15, when the final evacuation orders were lifted. |Smoke from the fire was dense at times across much of Northern California, concentrated by strong atmospheric inversions. Air quality was reported by the Air Resources Board as some of the worst on record, causing many schools to close and events to be canceled across the area. Visibility was below 1/2 mile at times.|The cause of the fire is under investigation, though there evidence suggests it occurred near damaged power lines.",CSV

The fire was not fully contained until August 30, reaching 229,651 acres in size with a total of 1,079 residences, 22 commercial structures, 503 outbuildings destroyed. There were also 190 residences, 26 commercial structures, and 61 outbuildings damaged. About 38,000 people were evacuated from their homes. There were a total of 8 deaths from the fire, 3 of them firefighters. A large fire whirl in Redding has been reported as being responsible for 4 of the deaths, and this has been listed as a separate event.
